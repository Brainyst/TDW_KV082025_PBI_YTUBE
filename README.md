📊 YouTube Influencer Performance Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This is my dashboard project, built using Power BI, to analyze YouTube influencer performance. The goal of the dashboard is to provide insights into how influencers are performing in terms of subscribers, views, and audience engagement.

📂 Data Sources
1. channel_master.csv → Contains influencer/channel-level details such as subscribers and language.
2. video_summary.csv → Contains video-level performance data including views and engagement metrics.

⚙️ Data Preparation (ETL)
1. Data cleaning and preparation was carried out using Power Query inside Power BI:
2. Loaded two CSV files (channel_master and video_summary).
3. Cleaned column names and applied correct data types.
4. Created relationships between the two datasets for integrated analysis.
