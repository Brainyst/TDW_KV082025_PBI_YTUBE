<h1> 📊 YouTube Influencer Performance Dashboard</h1>

<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>

This is my dashboard project, built using Power BI, to analyze YouTube influencer performance. The goal of the dashboard is to provide insights into how influencers are performing in terms of subscribers, views, and audience engagement.

<h3>📂 Data Sources</h3>
1. channel_master.csv → Contains influencer/channel-level details such as subscribers and language.<br>
